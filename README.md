# AirdropHunter-Automated-Blockchain-Transactions
Automated coin transfers, token swaps, token transfers and logical transaction routes. Ultimate solution for EVM chains.

I have reviewed numerous accounts that have received airdrops on the Optimism and Arbitrum networks.
When I saw that I could program these routes, I decided to write this program.
Tested on EVM networks only. It is still under construction, I will also work on rollups and nonevm chains in the final stage.
I'm thinking of writing a config generator via github.

Made special for upcoming zkSync Era and Polygon zkEVM airdrops.


TO-DO
* NonEVM Chains
* Github Config Generator
